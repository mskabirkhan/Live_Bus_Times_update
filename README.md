Live-Bus-Times-Update

This project is the implementation of an iOS mobile phone application which brings a solution to the user to their daily life.  The main purpose of this project is to develop a live bus tracking system to enhance the current bus service system for the passenger. The poor timing service provided by many bus companies is not updated for ages and user are ofter choosing alternative or some passengers are frustrated but they might not have any alternative to choose. 

Moreover, passengers are mostly impatient while they are waiting at the bus stand with uncertainty if the exact bus time is unknown or they had experience of the bus did not come at all.  

Out of many possible solutions, GPS(Global Positioning System) is selected to solve this problem in the initial step. There are many electronic devices available to send and receive the location but for accuracy and reliability, the mobile phone has been selected to share the location over other electronic devices. This system will need an internet connection to access the current location also to track the location of a bus.
